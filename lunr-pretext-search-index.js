  "body": " Physical Quantities   There are three fundamental physical quantities, length, mass, and time which are independent to one another. However, to completely express our daily life physical events these three quantities would not be sufficient so some more physical quantities were included later in the list of fundamental quantity and are altogether known as the base quantities. Their units are called fundamental or base units . The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the physical quantities are called the derived units . A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units. The diverse human history and geo-political issues gave birth to many systems of units some of them are now obsolete and some of them are still in use at different parts of world. The three different systems of units are considered here for discussion. They are FPS (foot pound second), MKS (meter kilogram second) systems, and CGS (centimeter gram second). The FPS system of units is also called British system and MKS system is also called a metric system. The metric system is a decimalized system of measurement developed in France in late century. Since the metric system is almost universally used, it is often referred to as the International System of Units and abbreviated SI. Since SI units use decimal system, unit conversion within the system is quite simple and convenient. The systems of units are summarized in table 1.1 .

Kilogram is the mass of a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder stored in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Saint-Cloud, France. A second is the time that elapses during cycles of a cesium-133 atomic clock. An ampere is the current which would produce a force Newton per meter if passes through two negligibly thin straight parallel conductors of infinite length when placed at 1 meter apart in vacuum. Kelvin is a temperature which defines the triple point of water as 273.16 K. A mole is the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12 isotope. One mole of anything is equal to Avogadro's number. Candela is the intensity of a light source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency hertz and has a radiant intensity watt per steradian in the same direction. Radian is the ratio of length of arc to the radius of a circle [ ]. Sterad is the ratio of the intercepted area of the spherical surface, described about the apex O as the center, to the square of its radius [ ].   Plane (a) and solid angle (b)               Derived Units   Derived units are the unit of such physical quantities which depends on the base physical quantities via a mathematical relation between them. Some of the derived units are expressed below.     Area =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system.     Density =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system, (lb stands for pound).     Speed =   i.e. in SI system, in CGS system, and in FPS system.     Electric resistance =   i.e. in SI system.     Magnetic flux =electric potential   i.e. or wb (weber) in SI system.      Dimensional Analysis  We can express the derived physical quantity by the dimensions of the base quantities. The dimensions of mass, length, and time are written as [M], [L], and [T], respectively. The square brackets round the letter represent dimensions of a base quantity. The dimensions of any other quantity will involve one or more of these basic dimensions. For example, the volume occupied by an object can be expressed as a product of length, breadth, and height, hence the dimensions of volume are . Similarly, velocity is a distance divided by a time, and hence the dimensions of velocity are . The dimensional equations of speed [v], force [F] and mass density can be expressed as , , and .  Dimensional analysis is a method in which the relationship between different physical quantities (or units) can be analyzed by identifying their base quantities (or units). Dimensional analysis helps convert the units of one system into another system or helps check the resulting formula in a physical process. Some quantities have no dimensions and they are called dimensionless quantities, e.g. the ratio of two lengths are dimensionless. The dimensional consistency does not guarantee the correctness of equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. Dimensional analysis is based on the principle of homogeneity which states that the dimensions of both sides of an equation are same. For example, in the equation below dimension on left is equal to dimension on right.   To verify that let us use the principle of homogeneity, i.e., which implies that both sides of the equation has the same dimension, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct. It must be noted that a dimensionally correct equation need not be an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) equation must be wrong.  Use principle of homogeneity to find the time period of the oscillation of a simple pendulum which is dependent on its mass, length, and the acceleration due to gravity. principle of homogenity From the given information, we have - or, [where K is a dimensionless quantity] Equating the power on both sides of the dimensional equation, we get - and    Some derived units are summarized in the table 1.2.

In every measurement there is some uncertainty. This uncertainty is called an error. The concept of errors can be understood by knowing the terms accuracy and precision. Accuracy refers to how closely a measured value agrees with the correct (true) value. Precision refers to how closely individual measurements agree with each other. For example, suppose the true value of a certain length is near 5.678 cm. In one experiment, the measured value is found to be 5.5 cm by using a measuring instrument of resolution 0.1 cm, while in another experiment, the length is determined to be 5.38 cm by using a measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.01 cm. The first measurement is more accurate (as it is closer to the true value) but less precise (as its resolution is only 0.1 cm), while the second measurement is less accurate but more precise. Thus every measurement is approximate due to errors in measurement. In general, the errors can be classified as (a) systematic errors and (b) random errors. The errors that appear due to faulty instruments or imperfact instrumental design are known as systematic errors. It is a repeatable error in the measurement. The systematic errors are     Instrumental errors: These errors arise due to imperfact calibration or design of the measuring instrument. Usually they are called a Zero Error . It is either a positive or a negative type. These errors can be removed by correcting the measuring device, e.g., in vernier calipers the zero mark of vernier scale may not coincide with the zero mark of the main scale.     Personal errors: They arise due to wrong observations, an individual's bias, lack of proper setting of the apparatus, e.g., parallax error, a person viewing a car's speedometer from the driver's seat will get an accurate reading because she has a direct line of sight. A person viewing the speedometer from the passenger seat will overestimate the reading because of the viewing angle between his eye, the meter, and the arrow.    The errors that appear due to system noise or disturbance of measuring location are known as random errors. It is a unpredictable and non-repeatable. Experimental error is one of the random errors. Experimental errors arise due to some external conditions of the instrument such as pressure, temperature, humidity, or magnetic fields, e.g., a thermometer placed under the armpit will always give a temperature lower than the actual value of the body temperature. This type of errors may also occur due to random and unpredictable fluctuations in experimental conditions (e.g. variation in temperature, supply voltage, local atmospheric pressure, etc) and personal errors (e.g., change in readings if the observer repeats the same observation).    Significant Figures   Significant figures are the digits which give us useful information about the accuracy of a measurement. The result of a measurement includes digits that are known reliably and the last digit that is uncertain. For example, the length of an object measured to be cm when measured with a meterstick marked with centimeter (0.1 resolution) and has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the last digit 5 is uncertain. If someone measure the same object with another meterstick marked with millimeters (0.01 resolution) one could have measured the length to be 287.54 cm and that contains 5 significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7, and 5 are certain while the last digit 4 is uncertain. Each smaller measurement allows observers to determine the length of the object with a bit more accuracy. Maybe someother can measure with great accuracy as 287.542 cm. No matter what you do, there must be some inaccuracy always come at every measurement. Scientists account for this unavoidable uncertainty in measurement by using significant digits. significant digits do not remove the uncertainty but warn readers to where uncertainty lies.   has one significant digit: only 1 is interesting and reliable. The zeroes may have been just the placeholders; they may have rounded something off to get this value.  1000.0 has five significant digits: the \".0\" tells us about the accuracy of the measurement that the measurement is accurate to the tenths place.  In scientific notation if 200 has two significant figures then is used. If it has three sig.fig. then is used. If it had four then 200.0 is sufficient.  Here are some basic rules to determine significant figures:    All nonzero digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the digits 3, 4, and 5 are significant.    All zeroes between significant digits are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0, 0 between 3 and 4 are significant.    Trailing zeros in the decimal portion are significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0,0 at end of 5 are significant.    Trailing zeroes in a whole number with no decimal shown are not significant; in number \"540\" there are only two sig.fig. 5 and 4, the last 0 is not significant.    Leading zeroes in the decimal portion to the first non-zero digit are not significant; in number 0.003004500 the 0 to the right of decimal point and digits 0, 0 to the left of decimal point before the digit 3 are not significant.    Exponential digits in scientific notation are not significant; has only three significant figures, 1, 3, and 2.      Rounding off the Numbers  When rounding, we examine the digit following to the right of the digit that is to be the last digit in the rounded off number. The digit we are examining is the first digit to be dropped.  If digit to be dropped off is less than 5, then drop it off with all the other digits to the right of it.  If the digit to be dropped off is greater than 5, then increase the number by 1 to the preceeding digit to be rounded.  If the digit to be dropped is 5, then round the preceeding digit so that it will become even number. Zero is considered to be even when rounding off. This is the process of minimizing systematic error. Here are some examples:    Round 742,396 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round to four sig. fig. start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. Then count to the right from there. The first four significant digits of 742,396 are the 7, the 4, the 2, and the 3. Just to the right of the 3 is a 9. Because this value is \"greater than 5\", round the 3 up to 4. Replace the remaining digits (the 9 and the 6) with zeroes. Then: 742,400 (four significant digits).  To round 742,396 to three places, start again with the 7 and include the next two digits, being the 4 and the 2. Since the next digit is a 3, which is \"less than 5\", leave the 2 alone and don't round up. Replace the three digits after the comma with zeroes. Then: 742,000 (three significant digits).  To round 742,396 to two places, use only the first two digits, which are followed by a 2, so don't round up. Instead, just replace the final four digits with zeroes, to get: 740,000 (two significant digits).    Round 0.07284 to four, three, and two significant digits: To round 0.07284 to four significant digits, start with the first significant digit, which is the 7. (The zero between the decimal point and the 7 is not significant, as it serves only to \"place\" the 7 into the hundreds place.) There are only three more digits, so all of them will be included in answer. Since no digit follows the 4, there is no information about rounding, so just leave the 4 as it is. Hence, 0.07284 is four sig-digs.  When rounding 0.07284 to three sig-digs, the final sig-dig is the 8, which is followed by the 4. Since 4 is less than 5, so simply drop it. Because these sig-digs are after the decimal point, not replace the 4 with a zero. Hence, 0.0728 is three sig-digs.  To round 0.07284 to two sig-digs, use the 7 and the 2. Since the 2 is followed by an 8, round the 2 up to 3; drop everything that follows. Hence, 0.073 is two sig-digs.    Round 425.35 to four and two significant digits: For four sig.fig. this number is 425.4, because the value to be rounded off (3) is \"odd\" and followed by a \"5\", then round the 3 up to 4 and remove the remaining digits. For two sig.fig. it would be 420, because the value to be rounded off (2) is \"even\" and followed by a \"5\", then leave 2 as it is and replace the other with zeroes.      Mathematical Operations with Significant Figures     Addition or subtraction: The final result should retain as many decimal places as there are in the number with the least decimal places in the data. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g is 663.821 g by mere arithmetic addition but the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. Therefore, the final result should be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in lengths of 66.25 m and 23.3055 m is . Which can be expressed as 42.94 only.     Multiplication or division: The final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. For example, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be , then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1.68804780876 upto 11 decimal places. But density should be reported to three significant figures.       "

  "body": " Algebra of Vectors   The mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication in the algebra of numbers are also capable of getting extension in an algebra of vectors. A vector whose effect is same as that of a set of two vectors is called the resultant of the given vectors. Let and are two vectors as shown in , then the resultant vector is the sum of and , i.e., as shown in .   Vector Algebra                     The resultant vector or the subtraction of from is the addition of a negative vector of (i.e., ) to a , i.e., as shown in . The resultant vector can be obtained by arranging the two individual vectors in such a way that the head of one vector falls onto the tail of another one without changing their individual directions. The resultant vector then joins the tail of first vector to the head of second vector (Remember the resultant vector is not in cyclic orientation of the individual vectors). If a vector is multiplied by any real positive number , then the product is a vector whose magnitude is times as that of and its direction is the same as . If is a negative number then the direction of is opposite to . If is a unit vector in the direction of then, we have   where is a magnitude of .   where and are scalars.   .   .      Components of a Vector:  A vector can be resolved into its components in a coordinate system.

Scalar (or Dot) Product  The scalar product of two vectors and is denoted by , and is defined as where is the angle between and .   Geometrical Interpretation:  Let and , as shown in , then = (length of ) (projection of along ).

  "body": " 1D Kinematics   Kinematics analyzes the positions and motions of objects as a function of time, without regard to the causes of motion. It involves the relationships between displacement ( ), velocity ( ), acceleration ( ), and time (t). The motion of object along one dimension has been analyzed in one dimensional (1D) kinematics.                              Displacement: It is the shortest distance between the initial position and the final position of an object. It has a particular direction and hence it is a vector quantity. In an object is at rest because the position of the object is not changing with the time. In object is moving along the curve path [ ] and hence the displacement after time [ ] is given by [ ].       Velocity: It is a vector expression of the speed traveled by a body in an specific direction of its motion. It is defined as a displacement over time or a rate of change of position. If the position of a particle at any time t is defined as , then its average velocity is given by where and are final position, initial position, final time, and initial time, respectively. Average velocity of a body during some period can be determined by drawing the slope of the line passing through the points p and q on the curve. The average velocity can also be calculated by using the formula if and , the initial and final velocities of a body are known and the motion of a body happen to be in a straight line with a constant acceleration.  Average speed, however measured using the following formula        Acceleration: It is defined as a rate of change of velocity. It is a vector quantity. If the velocity of a particle at any time t is defined as , then its average acceleration is given by where and are final velocity, initial velocity, final time, and initial time, respectively . If velocity is decreasing with time then acceleration is negative or also called deceleration or retardation.    Acceleration produced by the pull of the earth (or the earth gravitational force) is called acceleration due to gravity , which is given by .    Analyzing the motion curve       The slope in  vs.  graph gives instantaneous acceleration and the area between the velocity curve and the time axis gives the displacement. Acceleration relates to velocity in graph in the same manner as velocity relates to position in graph .    Reading of graph                   The specific features of motions can be read as follows from the graph: If position, x is increasing, then velocity, v is , if position, x is decreasing, then velocity, v is , if velocity, v is increasing, then acceleration, a is , if velocity, v is decreasing, then acceleration, a is . The slope of x t graph gives velocity and the slope of graph gives acceleration. The area under graph gives position [ ] and the area under graph gives velocity [ ]. Note that even if the shape of these graphs look weird all the motions happen only in one dimension, i.e., going up or down with time .  From , slope of line AB=+ve, slope of line BC=0, and slope of line CD =-ve, which means the object is running with constant velocity along +ve direction, stays at rest, and again starts moving with constant velocity along -ve direction, respectively. The slope of bottom portion of curve DE =0 nd that at top portion is +ve hence the object is speeding up in +ve direction. The slope of bottom portion of curve EF =+ve and that at top portion =0, hence the object is slowing down in +ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve FG =0 and that at bottom portion is -ve, hence the object is speeding up in -ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve GH =-ve and that at bottom portion =0, hence the object is slowing down in -ve direction as can be verified in figure . If velocity is constant there is no acceleration and if velocity is increasing in +ve direction, acceleration is +ve, if velocity is decreasing in +ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is increasing in -ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is decreasing in -ve direction, acceleration is +ve as can be seen from graph .     Equations of Motion   The equations of motion relate the displacement of an object with its velocity, acceleration and time. The motion of a particle can follow many different paths, but here we are considering the motion in a straight line, i.e. in one dimension. We are driving here three equations of motion for a constant acceleration.  From definition of acceleration, After rearranging, we get - Again,  also,       Relative velocity                   It is the velocity that an object would appear (to be moving or at rest) to an observer on the object and vice-versa. If is a velocity vector of an object relative to another object , then and the basic equation for relative velocity becomes:   From we have and from ,  where and are called absolute velocities of objects A and B, respectively. Consider an airplane is coming with velocity due south of east and another one is coming with velocity due west as shown in . Find the relative velocity of with respect to . To solve such problem assume that object is at rest. The object must be the object with respect to which we are finding the velocity of object .  To assume that the object is at rest take its velocity in negative direction to draw a parallelogram of adjacent vectors and so that their resultant velocity is . From , we have -       where the direction of relative velocity is given by     Problem Solving Technique     Linear Motion Problems: When motion problems become complex (say, more than one object involved, or a single object experiences complex motion) one must subdivide the problem into several sub-problems according to the following steps:  Draw pictures of the situation at the critical times denoting when one sub-problem begins and another ends. Label the drawings appropriately, indicating the positions, velocities, accelerations, and times involved. Use subscripts to distinguish the variables in one sub-problem from another.  Write the appropriate equations for each sub-problem.  Write the equations that relate one sub-problem with the others.  List the given quantities and solve the equations simultaneously for the unknowns.  To use equations of motion along vertical motion, take as negative and upward direction as positive.  Be careful on taking reference point (origin of coordinate). Choose the reference point at the position where event initiates or the ground in general.      Relative Velocity Problems: When relative velocities are involved, use the following steps:  List the given quantities in a form of notation that allows you to recognize which object is moving in what reference frame.  Draw a diagram showing the relationship between the vector velocities of the problem.  Write the equations relating the horizontal and vertical components of these vectors.  Solve the equations simultaneously for the unknowns of interest.       "

  "body": " 2D Kinematics   The motion of object along a two directions has been analyzed in 2D kinematics. An object fired into the air moves in a vertical as well as horizontal directions. Such motion occurs in a two-dimensional plane. The horizontal motion in a plane over the earth's surface is also a two-dimensional motion. The position vector of a particle in 2D is given by .    Projtile Motion               Projectile is a particle which has both horizontal as well as vertical motions. For example, a baseball in flight is a projectile. To analyze the projectile motion, three basic assumptions are made:  acceleration due to gravity is constant and is directed downward,  the effect of air resistance is negligible, and  the surface of the earth is flat.  To analyze the projectile motion, two-dimensional motion is separated into vertical and horizontal motions. The object in vertical motion experiences constant acceleration due to gravity. The object in horizontal motion on the other hand experiences no acceleration and hence it maintains a constant horizontal velocity through out its motion. Suppose a particle is thrown from the origin with an initial velocity ( ), along an angle from the ground level as shown in , then the x- and y- components of the initial velocity are given by and The horizontal distance covered by the projectile in any time is given by The vertical distance covered by the projectile in any time is given by here is taken as positive for downward direction. Hence velocities and angle of a projectile after time is given by  and   The time taken by the projectile to reach its highest point, and falls to the ground again is called a time of flight . The time for the projectile to reach the ground from its highest point is equal to the time of fall for a freely falling object that falls straight down from the same height. This is because an object in flight only experiences vertical force (weight of the object) in vertical motion but not in horizontal motion as soon as it is released from the thrower's hand. Projectile paths are parabolic and, therefore, symmetric. The object reaches the top of its rise in half of the total time of flight . At the top of the rise, the vertical velocity is zero. These facts can be used to derive the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile, also called the range . At maximum height, and ; therefore, the time of flight using eqns. and   and the range, can be calculated using eqns. , , and , or,  The maximum height is given by   If , then is maximum using eqn. . sketches the trajectories of projectiles thrown with the same initial speed at different angles of inclination. The trajectory of a projectile is parabolic in nature as can be seen from eqns. and ,   which resembles the parabolic equation .    Circular Kinematics       An object moving in a circular path is called a circular motion. In a uniform circular motion the direction of velocity is constantly changing but its magnitude remains constant. This constantly changing velocity vector produces the acceleration on an object which is pointed towards the center of a circle, called a centripetal acceleration. For this acceleration to happen there must exists a resultant force which is called the centripetal force. The centripetal force is not a physical force like frictional force, normal force, or gravity force, etc. it does not act on a body but it makes the body to rotate in a circle. This is a resulting force rather than a causing force like tension in a string, normal force acting on a body, frictional force between the surfaces of contact, and all fundamental forces. It is an unbalanced force. [ Note that the causing force always comes in pair.] If is the radius of the path, and is the time period, the time it takes to complete a circle, then its speed (linear) is given by For a uniform circular motion centripetal acceleration , is pointed along the radial direction towards its center and the tangential acceleration is zero. For a non-uniform circular motion there is still a radial acceleration but the tangential acceleration is non-zero pointed along the direction of velocity. If the centripetal force vanishes, the object flies off at a tangent to the circle.    Centripetal Acceleration:                   Consider a particle rotating in a circular path and reaches to point A from point B in a small time interval . The velocity vectors of the particle are at point A and at point B. The angular displacement subtends by the particle between point A and B is as shown in .  From quadrilateral OAMB of , and hence, as .  Now from radian formula, Dividing both sides by , we get-  From , also, Dividing both sides by , we get-   using eqn. where , is a centripetal acceleration. In uniform circular motion is called the radial acceleration. In non-uniform circular motion the magnitude of a linear velocity is changing with time, and hence there is another acceleration presents along the tangential direction of motion, also called tangential acceleration. Which can be obtained by differentiating eqn. w.r.t. 't',  Hence the resultant acceleration in non-uniform circular motion [ ] is given by     Angular Displacement, :  The angle subtends by an object when rotating in a circular path about an axis is called the angular displacement. In a 2D space, angular displacement describes a rotation of an object and is a simply number, a scalar. However, in 3D space, direction of the axis of rotation of an object need to be specified and hence it behaves as a vector. The direction of the vector is the direction of the axis of rotation, and the magnitude is how big the rotation was. Since angular displacement does not follow all the vectors rule in 2 dimension hence it is not taken as a vector quantity. For angular rotation in 2D, , i.e. not commutative for large angles. Suppose you have two pencils parallel to each other facing tips opposite to you. You rotate first pencil to about vertical axis so that tip facing left side, then rotate it again by about a horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward. Now rotate the second pencil by about the horizontal axis so that its tip facing upward and again rotate it by about a another horizontal axis so that tip facing left. Now you can see that they have different orientations, not parallel any more.    Angular Velocity, :  The angular velocity, of an object is defined as the rate of change of angular displacement, . That is, . It is measured in unit ( ). It is a vector quantity and its direction is along the direction of axis of rotation defined by right hand thumb rule. If fingers of right hand are curled in the direction of rotation of the body then thumb pointed along the direction of angular velocity. The average angular velocity is given by and the instantaneous angular velocity is given by     Angular Frequency, :  It is also known as circular frequency which measures angular displacement per unit time. Its unit is therefore radians per second. It is a scalar quantity. It is related to angular velocity in the same way as circular motion is related to simple harmonic motion. If an object goes around a circle path once in a certain time T (in seconds), then it has subtended radians angle, and its angular velocity is thus radians per second. , frequency and hence the angular frequency.    Angular Acceleration, :  It is the rate of change of angular velocity. The average angular acceleration is given by and the instantaneous angular acceleration is given by       Equations of motion in a circular motion:       "

Gravitational force is the weakest known forces in nature. It is a long range force. It exists due to mass of the objects. Electromagnetic force is also a long range force and is stronger than gravitational force. It exists due to charges of the objects. Strong nuclear force is the strongest known force but it is the shortest range force which only exists inside the nucleus. Its main job is to hold subatomic particles of the nucleus together. (i.e. binding the positively charged protons and neutral neutrons inside the nucleus). Weak nuclear force is weaker than strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It is also a very short range force and accounts for the radioactivity in unstable nuclei.    For a large-scale, electrically neutral objects such as those encountered in this course, the only force that acts at a distance is the gravitational force. All other forces we encounter will be contact forces (mechanical forces) that occur at the boundary of an object where that object physically touches some other object, e.g. tension, friction, normal, and other applied forces [ ]. Actually, mechanical force, or chemical force, or any other kinds of force are all electromagnetic forces. In our daily life almost all force we experienced are electromagnetic force except the force of gravity. Strong nuclear forces are very short range and we do not feel them dispite the fact that it is more powerful than the electromagnetic force. Weak forces are also short range and even weaker than electromagnetic force. mechanical forces     To identify forces acting on a body, first identify the boundary of that object and include the weight of everything inside that boundary. Then identify everything that touches the boundary from outside the object and include an appropriate force for each point of contact.    Look at the forces in .                 Note that massless, frictionless pulleys as shown below adjust themselves so that the tension is the same on both sides of the pulley. is a system of pulleys, is an isolated system, and a free-body diagram.                       Newton's Laws of Motion    Newton's first law provides the definition of force which states that every object in a state of rest remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that motion along the same direction, unless an external force is applied onto it. Force is not required to continue the motion of anything which is already in motion.  The first law is also called a law of inertia. Inertia is an ability of an object to resist changes in its motion. In other words, we can say the laziness of an object to change its mechanical state is called an inertia. Mass is related to inertia, the bigger the mass the more difficult it is to change its state of rest or motion.    Newton's second law provides the measurement of force which states that the rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied force and its direction is along that change.      Newton's third law provides the property of force which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Meaning, force always comes in pair. If an object applies the action force on object then the object applies the reaction force on the object . These pair of forces always act on two different objects. For example, if action force is acting on object B then reaction force must be acting on the object A.   If you stand on a weighing scale, your weight push the scale down with a force equal to your weight, then the scale applies the reaction force on you equal to your weight as a normal force. Remember that even if weight and normal force are equal they are not always equal and they are completely different forces. You get a normal force only when you are in contact with the other surface but you have the weight even if you are above the surface (while jumping) of anything. Suppose you are pushing the book against a wall, so that it does not fall. In that case, the book pushes against the wall and the wall pushes back. This interaction is the normal force and acts on both the book and the wall. None of these forces were equal to the gravitational force or weight of the book.      Friction  Friction is a resistive force that opposes or tends to oppose relative motion between two objects. It is a force that exists between the surfaces of contact of the two objects [ ]. If two systems are in contact and stationary relative to each other, then the friction between them is called static friction . This force arises from mechanical interlocking at the microscopic level plus the electrostatic molecular forces that hold the surfaces themselves together. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction . This force arises from forming and breaking of microscopic adhesive bonds between atoms on the surfaces plus some mechanical linkage between the small irregularities on the surfaces as shown in . Experimentally it is found that frictional force is proportional to normal force, i.e., as shown in .                    Where proportionality constant is called coefficient of friction. It defines the nature of roughness of the surfaces being in contact. It is a dimensional less quantity. The coefficient of friction is a property of materials and does not change with the angle. For static friction, N. The symbol implies that static friction can have a maximum value of . Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is being exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds , the object moves. Thus, . For kinetic friction, . Remember the direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion or applied force, not in the direction of normal. Hence the above equations has no vector form.  Friction decreases with increase in smoothness of the surfaces of contact as decreases, but if the surfaces are ultra smooth then friction increases because of inter molecular forces starts to act between the two surfaces as they come very close to each other, due to which it becomes harder to make them slide on each other. Friction is a complex force, and its behavior is still not completely understood. On molecular level friction has no existence. In microscopic level most surfaces look very rough as shown in . Thus, when an object is pushed to move it must raise the object until it can skip the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between he surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.      When an object is placed on the surface of an inclined plane and the angle of inclination is being increased slowly then at a particular angle the object just begins to slide, this angle is known an angle of repose, . At the angle of repose static frictional force is balanced by one of the components of weight of the object (see in section statics).    Force of Gravity: This force is acting on any object due to attraction of earth. Near the surface of the earth force of gravity is given by its weight, i.e., . Where is the acceleration due to gravity and the direction force is acting along the center of the earth. Normal:  normal This is a force of reaction from the surface where the object is placed. It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. Tension:  tension This force is acting between two objects on opposite ends of the string, in the directions to taut string at the points of contact. This force stretches the string along fixed support. It is a pulling force. Spring force: A spring is a special medium that has ability to restore its shape, if deformed. All materials have elastic property which helps them to restore their shape, if an applied deforming force has been released. From Hook's law a material (spring) exerts a restoring force that is proportional to a deforming force in opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. In mathematical form, The proportionality constant is a measure of the spring's stiffness, also called an elastic constant. The line of action of this force is parallel to the spring axis, and acts along the opposite direction of the displacement vector. The displacement must be measured from the relaxed (equilibrium) position; when the spring is relaxed.    Statics   When more than one force acts on a body in such a way that their net effects become zero is called an equilibrium. Equilibrium refers to a state of balance. An object is considered to be in a state of equilibrium when two opposing forces acting on the object balance each other. There may be two possible cases for a body in equilibrium,   Static Equilibrium: sum of all forces, i.e., and net torques i.e.,    Translational Equilibrium: sum of all forces, , i.e., .   Rotational Equilibrium: sum of all torques about a point on an object, . (i.e., )   torque        Static Equilibrium  A system is in static equilibrium whenever no part of the system is moving. An example of static equilibrium is a spider web suspending one or more bugs. Any segment of the web (any bug, any strand, any junction, or any combination thereof) may be treated as a body.    The vector sum of the forces acting on an object in static equilibrium is equal to zero. which is described by Newton First law or, equivalently  In static equilibrium, the total force acting on a body, , and also the velocity of a body .     Problem Solving Technique: To solve a static equilibrium problem one needs to:   Read problem, list given quantities, draw a figure of the physical situation, and label the forces involved.    Draw force diagrams (free-body diagrams) for each body in equilibrium.    Resolve the forces into components.    Sum the x- and y-components of forces and set them to zero.    Solve equations simultaneously for the quantities of interest.         "

  "body": " Center of Mass   The center of mass of a system of particles is a point in space at which the net mass of the system seems to be located. It is the mean position of the mass of a system or a body. Center of gravity is an imaginary point in a body where the entire weight of the body may be assumed to be concentrated or it is a point at which the gravity appears to act. In a uniform gravitational field the center of gravity is identical to the center of mass, but they do not coincide in a non-uniform gravitational field. Imagine that you are lying horizontally in space above the planet where you are experiencing a greater gravitational field strength towards your head than towards your feet, then your center of gravity is located somewhere near your shoulder rather than your belly button (i.e. navel or your center of mass). The center of gravity (or center of mass) may coincide with a geometric center of the body if it has a uniform mass distribution and possess symmetrical shape. An asymmetrical object composed of a variety of materials with different masses, however, has a center of gravity located at some distance from its geometric center. In some cases, such as hollow bodies or irregularly shaped objects, the center of gravity (or center of mass) may occur in space at a point external to the physical material. For example, the center of mass of binary stars lies between the stars and in the center of a tennis ball.      The center of (mass) gravity (point ) of any body can be determined by suspending the body by a cord attached at point and then by a cord attached at . When the body is suspended from , the line is vertical; when it is suspended from , the line is vertical. The center of gravity is at the intersection of and [ ]. When an object is suspended from any single point, its center of gravity lies directly beneath that point. For a group of discrete masses the location of center of mass can be defined as: or equivalently      Problem Solving Technique: To determine the center of mass of a uniformly distributed body, one performs the following steps:  Break the body down into its constituent parts.

As the speed of vehicle increases, the centripetal force needed for circular motion of the vehicle also increases. On the level road the frictional force between tire and the road provides the necessary centripetal force but as the speed increases this friction is not sufficient enough to provide required centripetal force which results in skid the vehicle off the road in opposite direction of the curve. To avoid such calamity the road is banked so that tire has protection from skidding upward. Due to banking necessary centripetal force is provided by the components of frictional force and normal force. Since the frictional force acts on a running tire and road is static in nature (unless it skids), it is directed towards upper edge of the slanted road if the car is running with low velocity or at rest. However the frictional force acts towards lower edge of road if the car has high velocity because the car has tendency to skid towards upper edge of the road.   "

  "title": "Torque",
  "body": " Torque   The rotational effect of force is called a torque. It is a physical quantity that changes the object's state of rotational motion. It is a rotational analog of force in a linear motion. It depends on the magnitude, direction and location of force that is acting on the body. Imagine we try to push a door to open it. How much push we apply to rotate the door depends on how far from the hinges (the pivot point ) and the direction we are applying a force. The closer we are to the hinges (the smaller r), the harder it is to push. The torque we created on the door is smaller when we push it near the hinge than it would be away from its hinges.  Consider a force acts on an object at a distance from the point of pivot in such a way that the object rotates about the point , then the magnitude of the torque about the axis of rotation through is given by                   From , where is the direction of torque acting on an object.  From , i.e., Torque = radius (perpendicular component of force).  From , i.e., Torque = force (lever arm).  The shortest distance between line of action of force to the point of rotation of a body is called the lever arm or moment arm. Torque is maximum when force and lever arm are perpendicularly to each other. There will be no torque if a force is applied at the pivot point (point of rotation) since the moment arm would be zero (r = 0). It is a vector quantity and its direction is always perpendicular to the plane describes by a lever arm and a force. Our right hand can be useful to find the direction of torque. Stretch your right hand fingures in the direction of lever arm then curl them in a direction of force. Now thumb must be oriented in the direction of torque. Since torque is associated with three dimensional case but the motion of object we consider here is only in a plane we make it simple by using the following convention.      Torque is taken as positive ( ) if it tends to rotate the object counterclockwise, and negative ( ) if it tends to rotate the object clockwise. The direction of torque and the direction of rotation can be remembered using the right-hand thumb's rule. The thumb of right hand gives the direction of torque, if the fingers curled along the direction of rotation of the body. The torque vector is perpendicular to and . When torque points into the screen, the rotation is clockwise and when it points out of the screen, the rotation is counter-clockwise. There may be more than one forces acting on an object, and each of these forces may act on different points on the object. Then, each force will cause a torque. The net torque is the sum of the individual torques.     Rotational Equilibrium  If the force is applied at an angle to the radius vector, then the lever arm is . An object in rotational equilibrium has no net external torque, i.e., sum of all external torques = 0. Remember that \"rotational equilibrium\" may mean that the object is either not rotating or may be rotating with a constant angular velocity. (3-D vector problems.)    States of Equilibrium  There are three states of equilibrium:                      Stable equilibrium: The body is said to be in stable equilibrium if its center of gravity lies below lowest possible position. A funnel standing vertically on its base on the table is in stable equilibrium [ ]. If the funnel is tilted a little bit against any side and then allowed to fall, it will come back to its original position. When the funnel is tilted against any side its center of gravity is raised [ ]. The line of action of weight passes through the base of the funnel. As long as the line of action of weight remains inside the base area funnel will come back to the original position. A torque due to weight of the funnel brings it back to the original position. For the funnel to tip over the line of action of the weight arrow will have to form a clockwise moment (or to pass outside the point of support). The funnel needs to have been pushed a lot for tip over. Some examples of stable equilibrium are bodies lying on the floor such as chair, table, book, etc. If a system in stable equilibrium is disturbed slightly, it oscillates around that state first but eventually settles down in exactly the same position as it started [ ]. It does this because its center of gravity is already at the lowest possible position.                      Unstable equilibrium: The body is said to be in unstable equilibrium if the center of gravity of a body lies above the highest possible position. A funnel standing vertically on its stem on the table [ ] is in unstable equilibrium. If the funnel standing vertically is slightly disturbed from its position it will not come back to its original position rather fall down on the surface of table. when the funnel is slightly disturbed its center of gravity is lowered [ ]. The line of action of its weight lies outside the base of stem. The torque due to weight of the rod toppled it down. Other examples of unstable equilibrium are vertically standing cylinder and pencil etc. An unstable system moves away from its original equilibrium state when disturbed. It wants to move away from the original position as soon as it has been disturbed [ ]. It does this because its center of gravity is higher in this state and when disturbed the center of gravity continues to move to a lower position (a more stable one).                      Natural equilibrium: The body is said to be in natural (neutral) equilibrium if the center of gravity of a body is at optimal position it is neither lowered nor is raised up. The object with lower center of gravity is more stable than the one with the higher center of gravity. A funnel lying horizontally on its side at rest on the surface of a table [ ] is in natural equilibrium. If a funnel is pushed slightly to roll, it will neither come back to its original position nor it will roll forward rather it will remain at rest. If the funnel is rolled, its center of gravity is neither raised nor lowered [ ]. This means that its center of gravity is at the same height as before. A neutral system is one where the center of gravity of the system is always at the same level. If it has been disturbed slightly it will therefore settle in the new position without a need to move further on or to move back [ ]. For example, a rolling ball lying on the table.     "

  "body": " Work, Energy, and Power   If an object is displaced along the same direction as the force is applied then the work is said to be done. If a force displaces a body to a distance along the direction of force then work can be calculated by .    Work   If an object is displaced along the same direction as the force is applied then the work is said to be done. If a force displaces a body to a distance along the direction of force then work can be calculated by . Work is a scalar quantity as it is a measure of transfer of energy from one object to another. The physical quantities which can be obtained by dot product of two vectors are scalar. The unit of work is joule in SI system, ; in FPS system, ft-lb = foot.pound; and in CGS system, erg = dyne.cm.               Suppose a block of mass is displaced to a distance along the horizontal direction by the application of force [ ]. If the force is acting along a direction to the horizontal, then work done by the force is given by The work done by a force is defined as the product of component of the force in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Work in physics is different than our daily life work. Suppose you are pushing a rigid brick wall very hard, after some time you get exhausted because you lose your body energy. In our daily life we called this action as a work, but in physics this is not a work because the object did not displace from its position. Hence in physics, whether the force or the displacement is zero, there is no work. Depending upon the angle between the applied force and the displacement, work could be negative, positive, or zero. For example, work done by a frictional force, or work done by a force acting opposite to the motion of object, work done by a force acting parallel to the motion of object, and work done by a force acting perpendicular to the motion of object,   The work can be found by calculating are area under the curve in force vs displacement graph. The sum of these area between initial position to final position along each direction is equal to work done by a variable force F(r), such as a force of spring.     Energy   The capacity of doing work is known as energy. It is a scalar quantity and it's unit in SI system is Joule. Energy exists in many different forms, such as thermal energy, sound energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, gravitational energy, chemical energy, mechanical energy, etc. The energy associated with the motion and position of an object is termed as mechanical energy. We focus our understanding here in mechanical energy. Mechanical energy is of two types, kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is associated with the motion of the object and potential energy is associated with the position of the object with respect to some other object. For example: elastic potential energy due to a spring force, gravitational potential energy due to gravity, etc. The sum of kinetic and potential energy gives the total mechanical energy of the object.    Work-Energy Theorem  From equations of motion, we have where , , and are final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and distance covered by the particle, respectively. From Newton's second law of motion, we have - From eqns. and , we have -  Here the term is called final kinetic energy, , the term is called initial kinetic energy, , and the term is work done by a force. Hence, Which is known as work-energy theorem . It states that work done by a net force acting on a body is equal to the chnage in its kinetic energy.    Kinetic Energy:  It is the energy associated with a body during its motion. The quantity is called the kinetic energy, i.e., The kinetic energy associated with a body in translational motion is called a translational (linear) kinetic energy. The kinetic energy in rotational motion is called a rotational kinetic energy.    Potential Energy:  The energy stored in a body due to its position is known as potential energy. If work is done by a force to change the position of a body, then this work is stored in the body at that position in the form of potential energy. The restoring force plays a crucial role to acquire potential energy. For example, a charged particle near or far from another charge; a squashed or stretched rubber ball, a body above the surface of the earth. The potential energy of the body at any position is the work done against the restoring force in moving the body from the zero point (reference point) to that position. The reference point The zero point is so chosen that it could be infinitely far away. Such as at infinity, at the center of the earth, at sea level, at the floor, at the table top, or at any other point. This is because only potential energy differences between two positions are physically measurable and cannot depend on the a rbitrary choice of the zero point. (or, the zero point ) is the point where potential energy is assumed to be zero. If work has to be done on a body to take it to a new location, then the potential energy increases in the process. If the external force does the work then the potential energy change is negative.     Gravitational Potential Energy: Suppose a body of mass is lifted to a height against gravity without acceleration, then work done by the applied force, is given by This work is stored in the body in the form of gravitational potential energy. Hence when this body is released from the position the body drops down to the ground again. Therefore, the work done by the gravity to pull that object towards earth's surface is given by This is gravitational potential energy in a uniform gravitational field, . The gravitational potential energy due to two point masses is given by Where is the mass of an object at the origin, is the mass of an object at a radial distance from the origin and the zero point is chosen at infinity.     Elastic Potential Energy: When the body (or, spring) is compressed or stretched external force has to do the work, this work is stored in a body (or, spring) in the form of elastic potential energy. It is the energy due to work done by a restoring force. where is the restoring force, is elastic (or, spring) constant (it defines the stiffness of the spring), and is extension in the spring.    Since work done by a force in principle depends on the path taken by the body, (as can be seen in where is a frictional force), but if the force is conservative then work done is independent on the path taken by the body rather it depends on the initial and final position of the body [ ].     Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces  If a body under the action of a force does no net work during any closed loop, then the force is conservative, otherwise, it is non-conservative. Non-conservative forces are dissipative forces such as friction or air resistance. These forces take energy away from the system as the system progresses, energy that you can't get back. These forces are path dependent and therefore it matters where the object starts and stops. Gravity, spring force, electric and magnetic, and other restoring forces are conservative. Friction, normal force, tension, and other applied forces are non-conservative. Conservative forces are state function, and non-conservatives forces are path function. The work done by a conservative force is independent of the path, i.e., the work done by a conservative force is the same for any path connecting two points.           Principle of Conservation of Energy  It states that in an isolated system, the total energy of the system is conserved. That is, energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be converted from one form of energy to another. For example, when a block slides down a slope, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. When friction slows the block to a stop, the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. In case of mechanical energy the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is conserved.      For an interacting system, and for an isolated system, . Mechanical energy is due to the position and motion of the object. Therefore, Consider a body of mass is falling from rest at height to the ground. We are interested in its total energy at points A, B, and C as shown in . From the principle of conservation of energy, total energy at any point always remains same, i.e., Where When the body reaches to point B, then and  Using equation of motion in 1D,   Similarly,  Which proofs that the mechanical energy remains conserved at each and every point of the motion of an object.    Energy Diagram               From the principle of conservation of energy as kinetic energy of the system increases its potential energy decreases. This means the force acting on a particle is the rate at which the potential energy decreases in any given direction as shown in . At point a, the slope of is positive, i.e., the x-component of the force is in the negative x direction. At the point b, the slope is negative and hence the force is positive. The force increases as the slope of increases. The point in the middle, at , is is a minimum of and hence the slope is zero. Therefore the x-directed force F at that point is zero as well. A point at which the force on an object is zero is a point of static equilibrium [ ], i.e., a particle is at rest and will remain there at rest. If the particle is displaced by a small distance to the right or the left of the equilibrium point, the force pushes the particle back towards equilibrium. Points where the force is zero and small displacements cause a restoring force to bring the particle back to the same points are called stable equilibrium points.  The forces between neutral atoms are extremely small, nearly zero, if atoms are very far away from one another. This is illustrated as an extended region where the potential energy is flat for large r as shown in . Such region is called neutral equilibrium because there are no forces that either restore or repel the two atoms. When two atoms reaches closer, their interaction becomes first weakly attractive due to quantum dipole-induced dipole interactions and then weakly repulsive as the two atoms start to touch each other. There is a potential energy minimum in between where two atoms separated by a certain distance can be in stable equilibrium without being chemically bound. If atoms approaches more closely then they encounter a second potential energy well that is at first strongly attractive to an actual chemical interaction between them followed by a hard core repulsion as the electron clouds are prevented from interpenetrating by the Pauli exclusion principle. This second potential energy well is often modeled by a Lenard-Jones potential energy corresponding to the inverse powers of . It also has a point of stable equilibrium. In between, there is a point where the growing attraction of the inner potential energy well and the growing repulsion of the outer potential energy well balance, so that the potential energy function has a maximum. At this maximum the slope is zero, a position of force equilibrium but because the force on either side of this point pushes the particle away from it, this is a point of unstable equilibrium . Unstable equilibria occur at isolated maxima in the potential energy function, just as stable equilibria occur at isolated minima. Introductory Physics-I, Robert Brown, Duke University     Loop-the-Loop Track  A loop-the-loop track loop-the-loop track consists of an incline plane that leads into a circular loop of radius . When a body at rest is released from a certain minimum height of the inclined plane it will make around the loop without falling. Assuming no friction during motion. The height of the ramp from where the body is released must be so chosen that when the body reaches at the top of the loop, it must be moving with the certain minimum velocity in order to have necessary centripetal force. At the top point B of the loop the weight and normal force are acting on the body downward. These forces must be providing a necessary centripetal force. Remember centripetal force is a resulting force it is not something that acts on the body. It must be provided by some other causing forces which can act on the body. Hence at point B,  For to be minimum, .         Now from the principle of conservation of energy   For to be ,   [from eqn. ] If the height of incline (ramp) is less than the body will not make a complete cycle around the loop and must fall during its vertical motion inside the loop.

  "body": " Power   The rate of doing work is called power.  Power defines how fast has the work been done. It's unit is Watt = W = Joule\/s (in SI unit), erg\/s = erg per sec (in cgs unit), and ft-lb\/s = foot-pound per second (in fps unit).  The old and more common unit of power is horse power (hp) 1hp = 746 W = 550 ft-lb\/s.    Simple Machine  A simple machine is a device that acts to increase or decrease the amount of output force, , by the machine compared to the input force, to the machine. Machines can increase the speed of doing work. Machine can transfer energy from one form to another.      A lever is a simple machine that consists of a beam (or solid rod), a fulcrum (or pivot point), an input force (or effort), and an output force (or load) [ ]. The beam is placed in such a way that the fulcrum acts as a point of rotation of the beam. The fulcrum remains stationary, while a force is applied somewhere along the length of the beam. The beam then pivots around the fulcrum, exerting the output force on some sort of object that needs to be moved. For example, a crowbar is used to pry up a nail, an effort force is applied to generate an output force, which is what pulls the nail out. Simple machine obeys the principle of conservation of energy, i.e., Input work = output work.    where is the distance of effort pushed down and is distance of load lift up.  There are three basic types of lever.     Class 1 Levers: This is a configuration where the fulcrum is in between the input and output forces, such as a seesaw (teeter-totter), catapult, pliers, and scissors [ and ].                  Class 2 Levers: The load comes between the input force and the fulcrum, such as in a bottle opener, crowbar, wheelbarrow, and nut cracker [ and ].                  Class 3 levers: The fulcrum is on one end and the load is on the other end, with the effort in between the two, such as with a pair of tweezers, stapler, mousetrap, and broom [ and ].                 Since lever works at rotational equilibrium, the total torque must be zero, i.e.,  Where and are lengths of effort arm and load arm, respectively. From eqns. and , we have -     Pulley                Another type of simple machine is a pulley. The pulley is just a lever in disguise. A single fixed pulley acts like a lever with equal arms. It changes only the direction of the input force. When a person pulls down on the rope, the load is lifted up as shown in . In a single movable pulley, the load can be lifted with an input force that is only half of the load's true weight .    Mechanical Advantage  Simple machine makes work easier to do. Mechanical advantage is used to quantify how easy to do the work by using simple machine. The number of times input force is multiplied under ideal conditions, i.e., when no friction present, is called an Ideal Mechanical Advantage , IMA. The number of times input force is multiplied under real world conditions, i.e., when friction is present, is called an Actual Mechanical Advantage , AMA.     Types of Pulley                              Single Fixed Pulley: This pulley does not multiply the input force. It does change the direction of the force from up to down [ ].        One Fixed and One Movable Pulley: This pulley does multiply the input force and change the direction of the force as well [ ].           Two Fixed and One Movable Pulley: This pulley change the direction of the force, and it also multiplies it [ ].            Two Fixed and Two Movable Pulley: This pulley change the direction of the force, and it also multiplies it [ ].      Suppose the load, then the actual input force would be a little greater than the ideal value of , say 25N in this case, It might be 30 N. The extra 5 newtons is used to overcome the friction.  The AMA will always be less than the IMA.    The value of IMA in case of pulley can be easily determined by just looking at the picture. Just count the number of strands of rope that directly support the load. In , there is 4 strands of rope supporting the load, In , 3 strands of rope supporting the load, In , there is 5 strands supporting the load, Besides lever and pulley, there are four other simple machines. They are the screw, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the wheel & axle.   Efficiency        "

  "title": "Impulse and Momentum",
  "body": " Impulse and Momentum   The quantity of motion contained in a body is known as momentum . It is defined as the product of mass and velocity of a body. It is a vector quantity. Its unit is in SI system. The momentum has same direction as velocity of the object. There are two types of momentum, linear momentum and angular momentum. The object moving with a linear velocity, has linear momentum and the object spinning with angular velocity, possesses angular momentum. Here only linear momentum (normally called momentum) is being discussed. The momentum of a system of particles is the sum of the momenta of the individual particles. From Newton's II law of motion, force acting on a particle is the rate of change of momentum and its direction is along that change For a system of particles total force can be,   In this expression because the internal forces are Newton's III law pairs and they are directed along the lines between particles of the system and hence cancel each other out. Therefore, the total force acting on the system is or, A force acting on an object for a certain time changes the momentum of that object, such change in momentum is called Impulse . If total external force acting on a system is zero, then total linear momentum of the system, This is known as the principle of conservation of momentum . That is where and are the initial and final momenta of a system. Momentum conservation is very useful in collision problems because the collision force is internal and hence does not change the total momentum.  The impulse of a collision is the total momentum transferred during the collision, where a collision is an event where a very large force is exerted over a very short time interval . During that interval magnitude of force is continuously changing, Therefore, the impulse of a force is the product of the average force and the time interval during which the force acts. That is, Impulse is a vector quantity and has the same direction as the average force. Unit of impulse is Ns.    Collision   A collision collision is an interaction between two objects that may or may not have made physical contact. In a collision the colliding objects experience a pair of forces acting on them. The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object and these forces are equal in magnitude. These forces are Newton's III law pair. In an isolated system, total momentum is always conserved, hence such forces often increase the momentum of one object and decrease the momentum of the other. There are two kinds of collisions, elastic collision and inelastic collision.  Total energy is always conserved in any types of collision. In collision three steps are considered to understand the problems. They are before collision: objects approach each other with a kinetic energy due to their movement, during collision: objects interact and transfer their momentum. The kinetic energy is transformed into elastic potential energy stored in the spring-like molecular bonds, and after collision: the stored elastic potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the objects move away from each other [ ].      Here and are velocities of body 1 and 2 before and after collision, respectively.  Consider two objects of mass and having velocity and , respectively are moving in 1-dimension and that so that they collide along their way. Suppose that both objects are subject to zero net force unless they are in contact with one another. During the collision, the first object exerts a large transitory force on the second, whereas the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. That is, they transfer equal and opposite impulses on one another at the instant of collision. If and are the velocity of the objects after collision, and there is no external force acting on the objects then from the principle of conservation of momentum, we have  This equation is valid for any 1-dimensional collision, irrespective of its nature.    Inelastic Collision  A collision in which total momentum is conserved but the total kinetic energy is not conserved before and after the collision is known as inelastic collision. That is, some of their kinetic energy is converted into heat, or sound, or deformation. If the two objects stick together after the collision and move with a common velocity then the collision is said to be perfectly inelastic. Most collisions in practice are inelastic. Perfectly inelastic collisions usually involve easily deformed obj ects e.g. wet clay. Since momentum is conserved in an inelastic collision eqn. can help solve the problem. In perfectly inelastic collision , after the collision, hence from eqn. , we have -     Elastic Collision  A collision in which total momentum and total kinetic energy are conserved before and after the collision is known as elastic collision. That is there is no dissipative force acting during the collision and that all of the kinetic energy of the objects before the collision is still in the form of kinetic energy afterward. Any macroscopic collision between objects will convert some of the kinetic energy into internal energy and other forms of energy, so no large scale impacts are perfectly elastic. Elastic collisions usually involve sub-atomic particles or highly rigid objects e.g. steel or glass balls. If both objects have same mass, their velocities swap after perfectly elastic collision, e.g. Newton's cradle. Collisions in which the objects do not touch each other, such as Rutherford scattering or the slingshot orbit of a satellite off a planet, are elastic collisions. In atomic or nuclear scattering, the collisions are typically elastic because the repulsive Coulomb force keeps the particles out of contact with each other. Collisions in ideal gases are very nearly elastic, and this fact is used in the development of the expressions for gas pressure in a container. Since total momentum and total kinetic energy is conserved in elastic collision, eqn. along with eqn. can help solve the problem,  and   On using eqns. and , we have - Divide eqn. with , we get -  Substitute eqn. in eqn. , we have -  Also,     Collision in 2D  A collision in two dimensions obeys the same rules as a collision in one dimension. That is,  Total momentum in each direction is always the same before and after the collision, and  Total kinetic energy is the same before and after an elastic collision.    Consider the first object of mass , initially moves along the -axis with speed and the second object of mass , initially moves at an angle to the -axis with speed .                  For inelastic collision: If the two objects stick together and move off at an angle to the -axis with speed [ ]. Then from principle of conservation of momentum,     For elastic collision [ ]:     These equations can help sove the 2D collision problems.    Coefficient of Restitution, e   coefficient of restitution    coefficient of restitution  The coefficient of restitution, is defined as the ratio of relative speeds after and before an impact, taken along the line of impact. If represents how fast the objects are separating from one another after collision, and represents how fast the objects are approaching one another before collision, then where, , , are final and initial velocities of the two particles, respectively. The coefficient of restitution, for perfectly inelastic collision and for perfectly elastic collision, i.e., .  If the magnitude of the relative velocity does not change during a collision, then the change in kinetic energy is zero. Collisions in which no change in kinetic energy occurs are called elastic collisions, . If the magnitude of the final relative velocity is less than the magnitude of the initial relative velocity, then the change in kinetic energy is negative. Collisions in which the kinetic energy decreases are called inelastic collisions, . If the two objects stick together after the collision, then the relative final velocity is zero, Such collisions are called totally inelastic. If the magnitude of the final relative velocity is greater than the magnitude of the initial relative velocity, then the change in kinetic energy is positive. Collisions in which the kinetic energy increases are called superelastic collisions,      Ballistic Pendulum      From the principle of conservation of momentum,   From the principle of conservation of energy,   From eqns. and , we have -  But  Where is called the muzzle velocity.

  "title": "Newton’s Law of Gravitation",
  "body": " Newton's Law of Gravitation       Newton observed that when an object, such as an apple, was released near the surface of the earth, it was accelerated toward the earth. Since the cause of such acceleration is an unbalanced force, there must be a force pulling that object toward the earth. On this basis he came up with an idea called Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation . It states that any two masses in the universe attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically,  Where and are masses of two objects, is the distance between them, and , is the proportionality constant, also called the universal gravitational constant. The value of G was first measured by Sir Henry Cavendish experimentally in 1798. The force is the force on mass 1 due to mass 2, the force is the force on mass 2 due to mass 1, and they are equal and opposite [ ].   universal gravitational constant      Acceleration Due to Gravity,        From Newton's II law of motion, when an external unbalanced force acts on an object, it will give an acceleration to that object, that is, . But, if the gravitational force is acting on the body near the surface of the earth, then the body experiences the acceleration for a freely falling body. This force is called weight of the body, . Hence, Where and are the mass of earth, mass of a body on the surface of the earth, and the radius of the earth, respectively. The shape of earth is not a perfect sphere, rather, it is an oblate spheroid. That is, the radius of the earth at the equator is slightly greater than the radius of the earth at the poles as shown in . Hence the value of varies slightly with latitude on the surface of the earth as since G and M are constants. The value of The mean value of Even though the variation in the radius of the earth seems quite small, the variation in the acceleration due to gravity on the earth goes from as low as at the equator to as high as at the north Pole.    Effect of the Rotation of the Earth on g      The value of on the surface of the earth does not only vary with the radius of the earth but it is also affected by the rotation of the earth. Any mass rotating in a circular motion needs a centripetal force which is acting towards the center of the circular path. Remember that a centripetal force is not a real force that is acting on a rotating body, but it is the required force that must be applied to keep the body in that rotational motion. Hence the part of gravitational force must be acting on a body to provide a necessary centripetal force to keep that object moving on a circle with the rotation of the earth as shown in .  Since the centripetal force required by the mass m to follow a circle of radius r, then this force must be provided by the vector difference in force of gravity and a real force , i.e.,   The magnitude of can be found by   where R is the radius of the earth, and the acceleration due to gravity on a non-rotating earth is     Effect of Altitude of the Earth on g      Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth is given by At height from the surface of the earth [Figure ], acceleration due to gravity is given by  using binomial theorem     Effect of Depth of the Earth on g      Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth is given by where mass of the entire earth, At depth from the surface of the earth, mass of the earth [ ]. Therefore the acceleration due to gravity at that depth is given by        Gravitational Potential Energy, U      The gravitational potential energy of a body is work required to bring the body from infinity to the particular position in a gravitational field. Let a body of mass is displaced without acceleration by a distance against the force of gravity, then work done by the external force is given by If a body is displaced from a position of distance to infinity [ ], then work done by the gravity, (or the gravitational potential energy) is given by by taking calculus approach.    Orbital Velocity of a Satelite      The velocity of a satellite in its orbit around the planet is called the orbital velocity, . To move in a circular track an object must need a centripetal force which is provided by the force of gravity between the object and the planet. i.e.,  Where , , and are distance of a satellite (object), mass of a satellite, and mass of the planet, respectively. is radius of the planet, is universal gravitational constant, and is the altitude of the satellite from the surface of the planet.    Escape Velocity      The minimum velocity of an object with which it can be thrown out from the planet so that it never come back is known as escape velocity. Suppose a stone of mass is thrown out from a planet with a velocity so that it never fall back on the earth again, then the total energy of the stone on the planet, is equal to total energy of the stone at infinity,    Where , , and are distance of a satellite (object), mass of a satellite, and mass of the planet, respectively. Here is radius of the planet, is universal gravitational constant, and is the altitude of the satellite from the surface of the planet. If radius of the earth, and mass of the earth is , then      Geosynchronous satellite      A geosynchronous satellite orbits the earth in such a way that it reaches at the same point above the earth in every 24 hours. It orbits in a polar orbit. The special kind of geosynchronous satellite is called geostationary satellite which seems to be at rest at the same position above the earth. It takes an equatorial orbit. The only force which provides the necessary centripetal force of such satellite is the gravitational force. Such satellites are used for weather forecasting and signal transmission. Where  and are mass, orbital velocity, and the orbital radius of the satellite, respectively. Also Where is orbiting time period of satellite. From eqns. and , we have - Since the angular speed of satellite in its orbit must be the same as that of the earth about its axis, the orbiting time period of satellite must be equal to 1 day. Therefore,  A geostationary satellite must orbit at a distance of about 36000 km above the surface of the earth, [ ].   "

For the earth around the sun perihelion is the distance of closest approach and \"aphelion\" is distance of the maximum separation (helio means sun in Greek) [ ]. For earth-moon system, \"perigee\" is the distance of closest approach and \"apogee\" is distance of the maximum separation (gee means earth in Greek).

  "title": "Moment of Inertia",
  "body": " Moment of Inertia   Moment of inertia is a property of a material during rotation. It is a measure of sluggishness (resistance to any changes) in object's rotational motion. Moment of inertia depends on the shape, mass distribution, and axis of rotation of the object. It is a rotational analog of a mass for linear motion. For a point mass the moment of inertia is just the product of mass and the square of perpendicular distance to the rotation axis. If a point object has a mass and is rotating about an axis then its moment of inertia, is given by where is a distance of the object from the axis of rotation [ ]. If there are an infinite number of point objects each at a distance are rotating about an axis, then the moment of inertia (M.I) of these discrete objects are given as                    as shown in .    Parallel axis theorem  The moment of inertia of a body depends upon the axis of rotation and there are many axes possible about which a body can rotate. Hence the parallel axis theorem provides a relationship between the moment of inertia of a body about an axis passing through its center of mass to any other axis of a body which is parallel to the axis through center of mass.      Consider an elementary mass at a distance from the center of mass of a body and at a distance from the axis of rotation through a point p [ ], then the moment of inertia of that point mass is given by   In this expression a moment of inertia of the body about an axis through center of mass, , the mass of a body, , moment of inertia of a body about an axis parallel to the axis through the center of mass, a distance between parallel axes, and   Since the position of the center of mass lies at origin (0,0), i.e.,  The parallel axis theorem states that the moment of inertia of a body about an axis parallel to an axis passing through the center of mass is equal to the sum of the moment of inertia of body about an axis passing through center of mass and product of mass and square of the distance between the two axes.    Perpendicular axis theorem      The perpendicular axis theorem states that the moment of inertia of a planar body (plane lamina) about an axis perpendicular to its plane is equal to the sum of its moments of inertia about two other perpendicular axes lying in the plane of the body.     Moment of Inertia of a Ring or Hoop                    As moment inertia depends upon the shape, mass distribution, and position of axis of rotation. Here are some conditions discussed below for a ring.    About an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane  Consider as a mass of a rim of radius rotating about an axis passing passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane [ ], then the moment of inertia of tthe whole rim is given by     About an axis passing through its rim and perpendicular to its plane  Consider a ring of mass and radius is rotating about an axis passing passing through its rim and perpendicular to its plane [ ], then the moment of inertia of that ring can be obtained by     About an axis through its diameter  The moment of inertia of a ring about its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane [ ], is Now using the perpendicular axis theorem, we have As ring is a symmetrical object is considered as equal to . Hence       Moment of Inertia of a Rod                  About an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane  The moment of inertia of a rod of length and mass about an axis passing through its center of mass [ ] is given by     About an axis passing through its one edge and perpendicular to its plane  Using parallel axis theorem [ ], here, is the distance between axis of rotation and an axis through center of mass of a rod.     About an axis passing along its length and through the center of mass  If the rod is negligibly thin (slender rod), then , otherwise depends upon of its shape, its moment of inertia can be obtained similar to that for a solid cylinder or as for a rectangular prism      Moment of Inertia of a Disk                      About an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane  Consider a disk of radius and mass is rotating about an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane [ ], then the moment of inertia of the disk is given by     About an axis through its diameter  Using perpendicular axis theorem, [ ]  and by symmetry,      About an axis passing through its edge and perpendicular to its plane  Using parallel axis theorem, [ ]      Moment of Inertia of a Plate       About an axis passing through its center of mass and parallel to its plane           About an axis passing through its center of mass and parallel to its plane           About an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane      Moment of inertia of plate about using perpendicular axis theorem,      Moment of Inertia of a Cylinder                      Moment of inertia of a thin hollow cylinder about an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane  The moment of inertia of such cylinder [ ] is given by, then the Here is mass of the cylinder and is its radius.    Moment of inertia of a thick hollow cylinder about an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane  [ ] here and are the inner and outer radius of the cylinder, and is its mass.    Moment of inertia of a solid cylinder about an axis passing through its center of mass  A cylindrical shell of length , radius , and mass [ ], then the moment of inertia of solid cylinder about an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane is given by Moment of inertia of solid cylinder about an axis passing through its center of mass and parallel to its plane      Moment of Inertia of a Sphere                  Moment of inertia of a hollow sphere about its diameter  Moment of inertia of a hollow sphere of mass and radius [ ], about its center of mass is given as     Moment of inertia of a solid sphere about its diameter  Moment of inertia of a solid sphere of mass and radius [ ] about its diameter is given by      Radius of Gyration  The radius of gyration, is a measure used to describe the distribution of mass or the shape of an object in rotational motion. It is the distance from the axis of rotation where the entire mass of the body is assumed to be concentrated that give the same moment of inertia of that body when it is rotating about an axis of rotation. It is an equivalent distance of the mass from the axis of rotation. It is helpfull to obtain the moment of inertia of a complex object. The radius of gyration of mass is given by Here refers to the radius of gyration of the object. The radius of gyration of a spherical body about its diameter can be obtained by considering the entire body is concentrated as a point mass at a distance from the axis of rotation and hence The radius of gyration provides a way to quantify how the mass of an object is distributed relative to its axis of rotation. Objects with a larger radius of gyration have their mass distributed farther from the axis of rotation, which typically means they are harder to rotate. Conversely, objects with a smaller radius of gyration have their mass distributed closer to the axis of rotation, making them easier to rotate.   "

  "title": "Rotational Dynamics",
  "body": " Rotational Dynamics   Just as linear dynamics describes the influence of force on a body and its transalational motion, in rotational dynamics torque describes the nature of rotational motion. Torque in rotational motion is a linear analogue of force. Actually, torque is a turning effect of force which acts on a body in specific direction and at specific position.  A general expression for the angular acceleration produced by a torque is quite similar to acceleration produced by a force in linear motion. For example, if a force is applied at the center of mass it will not produce any torque. It seems that no torque no rotation and it is right but in this case we have to consider no net torque. If the net torque acting on a rigid object is zero, the body will rotate with a constant angular velocity as we have seen in rotational equilibrium. The moment of inertia of a rigid body is a linear analogue to a mass. Torque plays the same role in rotational motion as force plays in translational motion. As we have similarly, if Remember, circular motion is not possible without centripetal acceleration and it has nothing to do with angular accelration. Direction of angular acceleration is along the same direction as a torque acting on a body. Angular acceration by defintion is acting along the same direction along which angular velocity is changing. Since , we have . Here is a tangential acceleration. If the direction of uniform angular velocity is changing the torque starts acting on the body and the body starts precessing.    Rotational Overview  The table below summarizes some of the physical quantities as rotational anologue to a translation motion.      Linear Motion  Unit  Rotational Motion  Unit  Relation                                                   W     Mass (M)  kg  Inertia (I)       p=mv  kgm\/s          Joule    Joule         Nms          J                Although the mathematical forms of the equations are quite similar, rotational dynamics differs from linear dynamics in the following respects. It applies to systems consisting of a single rotating object rather than a point particle; The motion of a body is due to rotational velocity rather than the translational velocity; and the agent which cause the motion is the net torque not the net force. In rotational motion axis of rotation must be specified to characterize the rotational motion.    Rotational Energy, Work, and Power  Whenever a rigid body is set into rotation about an axis, work is done by the torques. Which is given as Since the direction of the angular displacement is measured along the axis, and the torque is acting along the same direction on the body. If a constant torque acts on a rigid body which is rotating about a fixed axis, then from the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, assuming no loss due to friction, the work done by the torque will produce a change in the kinetic energy of the body given by      For maximum torque, , and Also, and  From rotational kinematics, where and are the final and initial angular velocity of the body, respectively and is angular displacement through which the torque is applied.    Angular Momentum  A rigid body rotating with angular velocity, about a fixed axis has an angular momentum about this axis which is given by where is the moment of inertia of the body about this axis. To change the angular momentum of a body, an external torque must be applied to it. Similar to in linear dynamics, we have in rotational dynamics That is, the torque acting on a rigid body is equal to the rate of change of the angular momentum. The direction of torque is along the change in angular momentum. The direction of angular momentum is along the angular velocity, which is along the axis of rotation. In the absence of external torques, the angular momentum of a rigid body must be constant, in other words, there is no change in the angular momentum when the sum of the external torques is zero. This is known as the principle of conservation of angular momentum, i.e., Similarly, the angular impulse Thus the change in angular momentum is equal to the angular impulse. Again,       Hence angular momentum is also called moment of momentum. It is a vector quantity. It is acting along the direction perpendicular to the plane subtends by and The angular momentum of a point particle is a measure of the circulation of the particle's linear momentum about some specific point. In , is a position vector of mass, measured from point  here is a component of velocity (or momentum) along position vector . If the position vector and the velocity are contained in the x-y plane then the angular momentum is either along the +z axis or along the -z axis. If the right hand fingers pointed along the position vector curl along the velocity vector, then thumb will give the direction of angular momentum. In the if the right hand fingers are along the red dashed line curled towards the momentum vector then thumb is pointed out of the paper.                   The angular momentum vector depends on the position vector of the point particle, therefore it depends on the point from which the particle's position is measured. Consider a particle of mass moving along the axis with velocity as shown in , then the angular momentum of this particle is given with respect to points and are   where is pointed into the paper [figure ]. Similarly,  and is pointed out of the paper [figure ].    The Gyroscope                It is a spinning disc or wheel in which the axis of rotation is free to orient in any direction. It is used to detect rotational movement. It is very useful in navigation, especially where magnetic compasses can't be used, such as in spacecraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and satellites. Wheels on a bicycle, for example, act as gyroscopes as they spin up to speed, making it easier to stay upright and harder to upset momentum.  In the , and are initial and final angular momentum after time respectively. is angular velocity of wheel rotation and is a precessional velocity. is the distance of wheel from the axis of rotation, . is the direction of torque being acted on the wheel because of its weight. The direction of torque can be given by right hand thumb rule. When the right hand fingers are curled from the direction along to the direction along weight then the direction of thumb will be pointed along the torque. Because of torque the direction of angular momentum changes every second hence the orientation of new angular momentum is given by    Earth precesses because of the torque produced on it due to gravitational tidal force of the Sun and the Moon.

The moment of inertia of the disk about its axle is The coefficient of static friction between the slope and the block\/disk is 0.05 and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the slope and the block\/disk is 0.15. The angle is Find the maximum ratio such that the disk still rolls without slipping up the hill.      Since the disk is rolling without slipping, the maximum friction acting on the point of contact of disk and ramp must be static (i.e., ). Now, whether the system is accelerating or not for the maximum ratio of can be determined by the evaluation of final equation. From the free-body diagram construct equations as shown below. From [Figure (b)] consider the disk is accelerating upwards with an acceleration for now, then           From [Figure (c)] the disk is accelerating downwards with an acceleration because the block is connected to the disk through same rope via massless and frictionless pulley and hence has the same tension and acceleration, therefore     Now from eqns. , and , we get - and from eqns. , and , we get - Hence from eqns. and , and we have -   If the system is not accelerating but moving with constant velocity, then Hence in that case        The disk of mass 45 kg and radius R = 0.3 m is rolled to the left until the spring is compressed 0.5 m and then released from rest.

The motion of the wheels, rocking chair, bouncing ball, a swing in motion, water waves, motion of planets around the sun, motion of clock arms, motion of spring-mass system, and motion of simple pendulum, etc. are some examples of periodic motion. If a body retraces its original path over and over about a mean position, then the body is in oscillatory motion . In oscillatory motion body moves to and fro ( or back and forth ) repeatedly about a fixed mean ( equilibrium ) position. Motion of a simple pendulum, spring-mass system, vibrating tuning fork, rocking chair, etc are some examples of oscillatory motion. A restoring force is responsible for oscillatory motion. A ball displaced a little from its rest position in a bowl performs an oscillatory motion. Circular motion of clock arms or wheels, etc. is periodic but not oscillatory. The wheels or clock arms do not move back and forth about the mean position rather they are moving in a circular motion is periodic not oscillatory. The motion of a pendulum is both oscillatory and periodic. All oscillatory motion is periodic but not all periodic motion is oscillatory. The motion of simple pendulum, spring - mass system, etc. is both oscillatory and periodic but the motion of wheels, motion of clock arm, planetary motion, etc. is only periodic. In periodic motion body also regain its all parameters after equal interval. The particles of a body get same velocity and direction at the same point over and over. If not then it becomes a random motion. In oscilattory motion, particle changes its direction of velocity at each point during the course of motion.    Simple Harmonic Motion   Phasor Diagram     If a body oscillates repeatedly ( to and fro ) between two extremes in equal interval of time then the motion is called a simple harmonic motion. It is the simplest form of oscillatory motion. The moving particle follows the same velocity at the same displacement of its oscillation and the restoring force always pointed towards the mean position. The bouncing ball motion is oscillatory but not simple harmonic. A particle moving in a uniform circular motion in a given phasor diagram [ ] can be seen as a foot ( ) of the particle executing SHM.  The angular velocity of the particle is therefore the same as angular frequency of the foot of the particle executing SHM as shown in . As the particle moves on a circle its foot, M executes up and down motion which traces a sinusoidal curve with respect to time. Some important terminologies are given below to understand SHM.   Amplitude, :  amplitude The maximum displacement of the oscillating particle on either side of its mean position.   Time Period, :  time period Time taken by oscillatory particle to complete one oscillation is called time period.   Frequency, :  frequency The number of oscillation completed per unit time is called frequency. If is the time period, then frequency, is given by    Angular frequency, :  angular frequency It is a circular frequency which measures angular displacement per unit time. Its unit is radians\/sec. It is a scalar quantity. In circular motion, angular frequency and angular velocity is used interchangeably.   Phase, :  phase It is the initial position (in angle) of a particle at time If the particle executing SHM is at mean position when then if it is at its extreme positions then         The followings are some features to recognize simple harmonic motion (SHM). Any of these features guarantee the motion is SHM in nature.  Restoring force is proportional to displacement from equilibrium position, i.e., where is a proportionality constant and is a displacement from the equilibrium.  ime period, is independent of the amplitude of oscillation.  Potential energy is proportional to .  The graphs for position vs time, ( ); velocity vs time, ( ); and acceleration vs time, ( ) are all sinusoidal [ ].      Equation of SHM  Equation for simple harmonic oscillation can be obtained by considering a spring-mass system, but the equation can be used for any other system performing SHM. Consider a block of mass attached to the spring and one end of spring is fixed to the wall. If the block is displaced by the distance from the mean position of spring-block system and released on a frictionless surface then restoring force of spring is proportional to the displacement. That is,  Where is proportionality constant, called a force constant. It defines the elastic property of material, hence it is also called elastic constant. For spring we may also called as stiffness constant. However, if the restoring force has some other source then elastic property of material then is simply a proportionality constant and depends on the nature of space, e.g. gravitational field in case of simple pendulum. sign here shows restoring force is always opposite to the displacement from the mean position. Equation is Hook's Law, we can discuss this law in the chapter Elasticity .   Where is the angular frequency (velocity) of the object executing SHM or performing circular motion. Angular frequency, is taken as because phaser always revolves anticlockwise. In the , is a mean length of spring-mass system and is displacement from the equilibrium position at any time . Here point is equilibrium position and points and are two extremes. The solution to SHM is given by       Where is a phase of oscillating particle. The displacement of oscillating particle can also be obtained by using Either solutions will work perfectly fine in solving shm problems. However, we can use cosine term solution if time when the particle is at its extreme position. If time when the particle is at mean position sine term solution will suffice. Here we are using as a solution for the differential equation. Time period of oscillation in spring-mass system is given by    Algebric derivation of particle's velocity in SHM:      Energy in SHM  Consider a vibrating spring with mass attached to its end, then the kinetic energy of the mass , and potential energy stored in the spring with a displacement is . Now since restoring force involved in spring mass system is conservative, the total mechanical energy is conserved [ ]. Here is a spring constant, is the amplitude of vibrating spring and the velocity of the particle executing SHM is zero at extremes. Let the spring oscillates in vertical up and down then the solution for SHM is given by      From eqn. , we have -  means mass is oscillating in up and down direction, i.e. Now  Note: The same result could be obtained by considering equation of SHM as        Summary of Phasor Diagram for    Points    s      KE  PE                                                                      Simple Pendulum      A simple pendulum consists of a heavy bob of mass hanging from an inextensible and massless string of length When the bob is displaced from its mean position and released, it will swing back and forth with periodic motion as shown in . From free body diagram, it is clear that is balanced by tension in the string but unbalanced force provides the restoring force. Hence   where is the angular velocity of the bob performing circular motion. The time period of simple pendulum can be given as     Alternative: The restoring torque acting on the bob is given by  As a restoring torque is giving a clockwise rotation when angular displacement is counterclockwise.    This is second order differential equation the solution of which can be written as where is called an angular amplitude.    Compound Pendulum      A compound pendulum consists of a rigid body that oscillates about a horizontal frictionless axis passing through a point . It is also called a physical pendulum. When a body is displaced from its equilibrium position by an angle then the restoring torque starts acting on the center of gravity G of the body which is given by    where   here,  is radius of gyration   Comparing time period of simple pendulum and compound pendulums we will get - This is the length of equivalent simple pendulum. If all the mass of a rigid body were concentrated at a point [ ] such that then we will get a simple pendulum of same time period. The point is called the center of oscillation . Now from we have - Which is a quadratic in a, whose roots are Therefore and Thus both and are positive. That is there are two positions of the center of suspension and center of oscillation about which the time periods are the same. The distance between two such positions of the centers of suspension, asymmetrically located on either side of C.G, is the length of the simple equivalent pendulum. Thus time period through point or is same. If the body is supported by an axis through , the time period of oscillation would be infinite.   "

  "title": "Hooke’s Law",
  "body": " Hooke's Law   Hook's law states that within the elastic limit, stress is proportional to strain. Stress, : It is an internal pressure exerted by the material. It is equal and opposite to the applied pressure. Stress is defined as a force per unit cross-sectional area.  Strain, : It is a change in dimension of the material per unit original dimension.         If the deforming force is applied on a material, initially strain increases gradually and remains proportional to the stress for a certain limit. After this high stress the atoms are pulled permanently away from their equilibrium position in the lattice structure. The maximum stress which the wire can experience and still return to its original length is called the elastic limit and the region is called elastic region as shown in . Hooke's law holds good only within this limit. If the stress is increased beyond this limit, the ultimate stress point is reached which is the highest point on the stress-strain curve. This is the greatest stress that the material can bear. Brittle materials break suddenly at this point, while some ductile materials can be stretched a little more due to a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the material. But they too break shortly thereafter at the breaking point. This region is called a plastic region.    Elastic Modulus   From Hook's law,  where is a proportionality constant, called modulus of elasticity. It is a material property which defines how stiff is the material. Hence modulus of elasticity, defines stress per unit strain. Its unit is Pascal (Pa). In the deformation process material stores energy in the form of potential energy or dissipates energy plastically. Stress is not directly measurable. We can calculate stress differently using applied tension, tangential force, compressional force, etc.    Young's Modulus or Elasticity of Length      Consider a rod of length whose top face is fixed and a normal force is being applied on its bottom face as shown in , then from Hook's law, normal (tensile) stress longitudinal strain, that is where is called Young's modulus, is cross-sectional area of wire, and is an original length. Hence    Young's modulus  Its unit is When a wire under tension is elongated, its width is slightly diminished. This lateral shrinkage constitutes a transverse strain that is equal to the change in the width divided by the original width, i.e., The ratio of the lateral contraction (transverse strain) to the elongation (longitudinal strain) is called Poisson's ratio . Tensile deformation is considered positive and compressive deformation is considered negative. The material which does not contract is brittle and the one which contracts is ductile. Poisson ratio of any material lies between 0 to 0.5.    Bulk Modulus or Elasticity of Volume      Consider a cube of surface area whose volume is being compressed by applying a deforming force as shown in . Now from Hook's law, volumetric stress volumetric strain, that is where is called bulk modulus or coefficient of volumetric elasticity. Hence Here is a deforming force, is surface area of a cube, is change in volume , and sign shows compression.    Shear Modulus (Modulus of Rigidity) or Elasticity of Shape  When a tangential force is applied on one of the faces of any material keeping opposite face fixed, it deforms its shape. Hence from Hook's law, shear stress shear strain. The elastic property of a body that causes the shape of the body to be changed when a stress is applied is called shear stress. The angle of shear, which is a measure of how much the body's shape has been deformed is called shear strain. When the shear stress is removed the body returns to its original shape.      Consider a cube of sides y whose bottom face is fixed and a tangential force is being applied on its top face as shown in , then from Hook's law, shear stress shear strain, that is   where is called modulus of shape or shear modulus. Hence Here is a deforming force, is surface area of a cube, and is a shear angle.     Hook's Law for a Spring      From Hook's law,    Since cross-sectional area, , length of spring, , and elastic constant of spring material, are constant, we can assume which provides stiffness constant of a spring it is also called a force constant. where .    Elastic Potential Energy  When a force is applied to deform the shape of a material work has been done against the restoring force of a material hence this work is stored in a material in the form of elastic potential energy. Suppose a wire is stretched to a distance by applying a deforming force, then work done by the force is given by But for a restoring force, Hence work done by a restoring force is given by and the work done by a deforming force is given by This work is stored in the spring as potential energy. That is,    "
