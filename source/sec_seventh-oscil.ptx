  <title>Oscillatory Motion</title>
  
   <introduction>
    <p>
      If a body repeats its motion after a fixed interval of time, then the body 
      is said to be in <term>periodic motion</term>. In periodic motion object returns 
      to its original position at some later time. The motion of the wheels, rocking chair, 
      bouncing ball, a swing in motion, water waves,  motion of planets around the sun, 
      motion of clock arms, motion of spring-mass system, and motion of simple pendulum, etc. 
      are some examples of periodic motion. If a body retraces its original path over and 
      over about a mean position, then the body is in <term>oscillatory motion</term>. 
      In oscillatory motion body moves to and fro (<em>or back and forth</em>) repeatedly 
      about a fixed mean (<em>equilibrium</em>) position. Motion of a simple pendulum, 
      spring-mass system, vibrating tuning fork, rocking chair, etc are some examples of 
      oscillatory motion.  A restoring force is responsible for oscillatory motion. 
      A ball displaced a little from its rest position in a bowl performs an oscillatory motion. 
      Circular motion of clock arms or wheels, etc. is periodic but not oscillatory. 
      The wheels or clock arms do not move back and forth about the mean position rather 
      they are moving in a circular motion is periodic not oscillatory. The motion of a 
      pendulum is both oscillatory and periodic. All oscillatory motion is periodic but 
      not all periodic motion is oscillatory. The motion of simple pendulum, spring - mass system, 
      etc. is both oscillatory and periodic but the motion of wheels, motion of clock arm, 
      planetary motion, etc. is only periodic. In periodic motion body also regain its all 
      parameters after equal interval. The particles of a body get same velocity and 
      direction at the same point over and over. If not then it becomes a random motion. 
      In oscilattory motion, particle changes its direction of velocity at each point 
      during the course of motion.

    <introduction>
      <p>
       If a body oscillates repeatedly (<em>to and fro</em>) between two extremes in 
    equal interval of time then the motion is called a simple harmonic motion. It is 
    the simplest form of oscillatory motion.  The moving particle follows the same 
    velocity at the same displacement of its oscillation and the restoring force 
    always pointed towards the mean position. The bouncing ball motion is oscillatory 
    but not simple harmonic. A particle moving in a uniform circular motion in a 
    given phasor diagram [<xref ref="rfcc"/>] can be seen as a foot 
    (<m>M</m>) of the particle executing SHM. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The angular velocity of the particle  is therefore the same as angular frequency of 
    the foot of the particle executing SHM as shown in <xref ref="rfcc"/>. 
    As the particle moves on a circle its foot, M executes up and down motion which 
    traces a sinusoidal curve with respect to time. Some important terminologies 
    are given below to understand SHM.

  <title>Equation of SHM</title>
  <p>
    Equation for simple harmonic oscillation can be obtained by considering a spring-mass system, 
    but the equation can be used for any other system performing SHM. Consider a block of mass <m>m</m> 
    attached to the spring and one end of spring is fixed to the wall. If the block is displaced 
    by the distance <m>x</m> from the mean position of spring-block system and released on a 
    frictionless surface then restoring force of spring is proportional to the displacement. That is,
    <me>
      F_{s}  \varpropto x.
    </me>
    <men xml:id="eqn-shm1">
      \text{or,}\quad F_{s}  =-k x
    </men>
       Where <m>k</m> is proportionality constant, called a force constant. It defines the 
       elastic property of material, hence it is also called elastic constant. For spring 
       we may also called <m>k</m> as stiffness constant. However, if the restoring force 
       has some other source then elastic property of material then <m>k</m> is simply 
       a proportionality constant and depends on the nature of space, e.g. gravitational 
       field in case of simple pendulum. <m>-ve</m> sign here shows restoring force is 
       always opposite to the displacement from the mean position. 
       <fn>Equation <xref ref="eqn-shm1"/> is  Hook's Law, we can discuss this law in 
        the chapter <alert>Elasticity</alert>.</fn>

        </men>
        Where <m>\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}=\omega,</m> is the angular frequency (velocity) 
        of the object executing SHM or performing circular motion. Angular frequency, 
        <m>\omega</m> is taken as <m>+ve</m> because phaser always revolves anticlockwise. 
        In the <xref ref="shm1"/>, <m>l</m> is a mean length of spring-mass system 
        and <m>x</m> is displacement from the equilibrium position at any time <m>t</m>. 
        Here point <m>O</m> is equilibrium position and points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two extremes. 
       The solution to SHM is given by

Where <m>\phi =\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x_{o}}{A}\right)</m> is a phase of oscillating particle. 
The displacement of oscillating particle can also be obtained by using 
<me>
  x=A\cos(\omega t + \phi).

Either solutions will work perfectly fine in solving shm problems. However, we can use 
cosine term solution if time <m> t = 0 </m> when the particle is at its extreme position. 
If time <m>t = 0</m> when the particle is at mean position sine term solution will suffice.
Here we are using

        Comparing time period of simple pendulum and compound pendulums we will get -

        This is the length of equivalent simple pendulum.  If all the mass of a

          SO= \frac{k^{2}+a^{2}}{a}

          then we will get a simple pendulum of same time period. The point <m>O</m> is called

            l=\frac{k^{2}+a^{2}}{a},

           we have -

            a^{2}-la+k^{2} =0

            a=\frac{l\pm\sqrt{l^{2}-4k^{2}}}{2}

           Therefore

            a_{1} +a_{2} =l

          Thus both <m>a_{1}</m> and <m>a_{2}</m> are positive. That is there are 
          two positions of the center of suspension and center of oscillation about 
          which the time periods are the same.  The distance between two such positions 
          of the centers of suspension, asymmetrically located on either side of C.G, 
          is the length <m>l=a+b</m> of the simple equivalent pendulum. Thus time period 
          through point <m>S</m> or <m>O</m> is same. If the body is supported by an 
          axis through <m>G</m>, the time period of oscillation would be infinite.
