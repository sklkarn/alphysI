  <title>1D Kinematics</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Kinematics analyzes the positions and motions of objects as a function of time, 
      without regard to the causes of motion. It involves the relationships between 
      displacement (<m>\vec{s}</m>), velocity (<m>\vec{v}</m>), acceleration 
      (<m>\vec{a}</m>), and time (t). The motion of object along one dimension has been 
      analyzed in one dimensional (1D) kinematics.

          It has a particular direction and hence it is a vector quantity. In <xref ref="fig3"/> 
          an object is at rest because the position of the object is not changing with the time. 
          In <xref ref="fig3a"/> object is moving along the curve path [<m>x=x(t)</m>] and hence the 
          displacement after time [<m>\Delta t = t_{f}-t_{i}</m>] is given by [<m>\,ds=x_{f}-x_{i}</m>].

          <alert>Velocity:</alert> It is a vector expression of the speed traveled by a body in an specific direction of its motion. 
          It is defined as a displacement over time or a rate of change of position. If the position of a 
          particle at any time t is defined as  <m>x  =  x(t)</m>, then its average velocity is given by

        by drawing the slope of the line passing through the points p and q on the curve. 
        The average velocity can also be calculated by using the formula

      The specific features of motions can be read as follows from the graph: 
      If position, x is increasing, then velocity, v is <m>+ve</m>, if position, x is decreasing, 
      then velocity, v is <m>-ve</m>, if velocity, v is increasing, then acceleration, 
      a is <m>+ve</m>, if velocity, v is decreasing, then acceleration, a is <m>-ve</m>. 
      The slope of x <m>x \sim t </m> t graph gives velocity and the slope of <m>v \sim t</m> 
      graph gives acceleration. The area under <m> v \sim t</m> graph gives position 
      [<m>x=vt</m>] and  the area under <m>a \sim t</m> graph gives velocity [<m>v=at</m>]. 
      Note that even if the shape of these graphs look weird all the motions happen only 
      in one dimension, i.e., going up or down with time <xref first="fig3e" last="fig3f"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From <xref ref="fig3f"/>, slope of line AB=+ve, slope of line BC=0, 
      and slope of line CD =-ve, which means the object is running with constant 
      velocity along +ve direction, stays at rest, and again starts moving with constant 
      velocity along -ve direction, respectively. The slope of bottom portion of curve DE =0 
      nd that at top portion is +ve hence the object is speeding up in +ve direction.  The 
      slope of bottom portion of curve EF =+ve and that at top portion =0, hence the object 
      is slowing down in +ve direction. The slope of top portion of curve FG =0 and that at 
      bottom portion is -ve, hence the object is speeding up in -ve direction. The slope of 
      top portion of curve GH =-ve and that at bottom portion =0, hence the object is slowing 
      down in -ve direction as can be verified in figure <xref ref="fig3g"/>. If velocity is constant 
      there is no acceleration and if velocity is increasing in +ve direction, acceleration 
      is +ve, if velocity is decreasing in +ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is 
      increasing in -ve direction, acceleration is -ve, if velocity is decreasing in -ve direction, 
      acceleration is +ve as can be seen from graph <xref ref="fig3h"/>.

  <title>Equations of Motion</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The equations of motion relate the displacement of an object with its velocity, 
      acceleration and time. The motion of a particle can follow many different paths, 
      but here we are considering the motion in a straight line, i.e. in one dimension. 
      We are driving here three equations of motion for a constant acceleration.

  <p>
    It is the velocity that an object <m>A</m> would appear (to be moving or at rest) 
    to an observer on the object <m>B</m> and vice-versa. If <m>v_{AB}</m> is a  velocity vector of 
    an object <m>A</m> relative to another object <m>B</m>, then
<me>
  \vec{v}_{AB}  =  - \vec{v}_{BA}
</me>
  and the basic equation for relative velocity becomes:
  <me>
    \vec{v}_{az}  =  \vec{v}_{ab}  +  \vec{v}_{bc}  +  \cdots +  \vec{v}_{yz} 
  </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    From <xref ref="fig3i"/>  we have 
    <me>
      \vec{v}_{A}+\vec{v}_{BA} = \vec{v}_{B}
    </me>
    and from <xref ref="fig3j"/>,
    <me>
       -\vec{v}_{A}+\vec{v}_{B} = \vec{v}_{BA};
    </me>
    <me>
      \therefore \vec{v}_{BA}  =\vec{v}_{B}-\vec{v}_{A}
    </me>
where <m>\vec{v}_{A} </m> and <m>\vec{v}_{B}</m>  are called absolute velocities of objects A and B, respectively.
Consider an airplane <m>A</m> is coming with velocity <m>\vec{v}_{A} =600 \quad km/h</m> due 
<m>\theta=35^{o}</m> south of east and another one <m>B</m> is coming with velocity 
<m>\vec{v}_{A} =700 \quad km/h</m> due west as shown in <xref ref="fig3k"/>. Find the relative
velocity of <m>B</m> with respect to <m>A</m>. To solve such problem assume that object 
<m>A</m> is at rest. The object <m>A</m> must be the object with respect to which 
we are finding the velocity of object <m>B</m>.  
 </p>
 <p>
  To assume that the object <m>A</m> is at rest take its velocity in negative direction 
  to draw a parallelogram of adjacent vectors <m>\vec{v}_{B}</m> and <m>-\vec{v}_{A}</m> 
  so that their resultant velocity is <m> \vec{v}_{BA} </m>. From <xref ref="fig3k"/>, we have -
  <me>
    \vec{v}_{BA} = -\vec{v}_{A}+\vec{v}_{B};
  </me>
  <me>
    v_{Bx}=v_{B}\cos\theta = 491.5 \quad km/h, 
  </me>
  <me>
    v_{By}=v_{B}\sin\theta = 344 \quad km/h, 
  </me>
 
  <me>
  \text{and,} \, v_{A}=700 \quad km/h
  </me>
 <me>
  v_{Rx}=v_{A}+v_{Bx}=1191.5 \quad km/h; 
 </me>
 <me>
  v_{Ry}=v_{By}=344 \quad km/h
 </me>
<me>
  \therefore v_{BA} = \sqrt{v^{2}_{Rx}+ v^{2}_{Ry}} = 1240.16 km/h

where the direction of relative velocity is given by 
<me>
  \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{v_{Ry}}{v_{Rx}}\right) = 16^{o} \quad \text{S of E}.
